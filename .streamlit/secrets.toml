# Copy this file to .streamlit/secrets.toml (for local dev)
# On Streamlit Community Cloud, add these in the app's Secrets UI instead.

# --- OpenAI Cloud (optional) ---
# If you want cloud AI features:
openai_api_key = "sk-..."          # your OpenAI API key
openai_model   = "gpt-4o-mini"     # optional; can be overridden in the UI

# --- OpenAI-compatible (FREE local) ---
# If you are running a local server like Ollama or LM Studio:
# openai_base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"  # Ollama default
# openai_api_key  = "ollama"                     # any string works for Ollama
# openai_model    = "llama3.1:8b-instruct"       # or your chosen local model

# Notes:
# - For Streamlit Cloud, do NOT set base_url to localhost. Use a hosted API.
# - The app also respects environment variables OPENAI_API_KEY / OPENAI_BASE_URL / OPENAI_MODEL.
